# Shopify-Waste-Wizard
Shopify Waste Wizard Challenge for the Web Engineering Internship position

# Note
After reading the challenge specifications several times, I was a bit confused about whether or not to match keys based on each invidual string, or to also take in matches that have a matching substring! I went along with the matching substring option, but to fix this would be a very minor change in the code!

This is my second attempt ever using React as a web development framework, and I realize there's a lot of thinks I could've have improved on given more knowledge and experience using React! I will continue expanding my knowledge in React as I move forward in my career.

# Compilation
npm install
npm start
site will be hosted on localhost port 3000

# Structure
src/index.js: is simply used to combine all components together
src/header.js: only renders the site header
src/search.js: this file technically contains two components (Search component and Favorite component), but since they heavily rely on each other I decided to combine both components into one file to make communication between them significantly easier.
